I'd like to thank my committee members Dr. Yantao Shen, Dr. Sergiu Dascalu, and Dr. Fred Harris Jr. I would like to give additional thanks to Dr. Fred Harris Jr., who has allowed me to work in the Brain Computation Lab for the last three years and has provided a great deal of assistance in my pursuit to complete my thesis and graduate study at the University of Nevada. I would also like to thank my fellow grad students Roger Hoang, Devyani Tanna, and Torbjorn Loken for a wealth of insight and moral support.
